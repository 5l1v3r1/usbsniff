Develop hardware usb 2.0 sniffer

The main idea - to develop cheap hardware usb sniffer which possible to assemble at home :)
The 1st stage - draw schematic and pcb based on MAX3421. However, this solution allow control 
EP1: OUT, BULK or INTERRUPT
EP2: IN, BULK or INTERRUPT
EP3: IN, BULK or INTERRUPT

Next step - desing sniffer based on TX2UL + galvanic isolation
